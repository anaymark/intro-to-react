# In your own words, explain the React core concept of encapsulation. Discuss why this React principle is important in application development.
> Encapsulation is a term that can be seen as a relative reusability x isolation of a react component. What I mean by this is how do we decide when a component is to big and needs to be broken down into smaller pars? How do we decide the components modularity? This is what encapsulation at it's core, create small, generic things. Components small to the point that you cannot make them any smaller, the smallest level of responsibility. This makes these components reusable at the highest level, and allows React to be a modular language.
